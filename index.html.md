I’m modifying the nbdev tutorial so that it can be run in Colab. It is a
little bit of extra work to set up, but otherwise works about the same.
You can edit notebooks easily in colab, and if everything is set up
correctly, github actions will run the commands that are necessary to
process the notebooks and turn the repo into a static site. But for some
processing another notebook may be needed to run the nbdev commands (or
you can use the existing notebook and run the nbdev commands in the
terminal).

This file will become your README and also the index of your
documentation. It is in
<https://github.com/abecode/nbdev-hello-world/blob/main/nbs/index.ipynb>.
It will eventually be processed and show up as the repo’s landing
page/README.md<https://github.com/abecode/nbdev-hello-world>, but it has
to be processed first.
