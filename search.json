You can edit notebooks easily in colab, and if everything is set up correctly, github actions will run the commands that are necessary to process the notebooks and turn the repo into a static site. But for some processing another notebook may be needed to run the nbdev commands (or you can use the existing notebook and run the nbdev commands in the terminal).\nThis file will become your README and also the index of your documentation. It is in https://github.com/abecode/nbdev-hello-world/blob/main/nbs/index.ipynb. It will eventually be processed and show up as the repo’s landing page/README.mdhttps://github.com/abecode/nbdev-hello-world, but it has to be processed first.",
